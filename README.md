## About the Bootcamp

The Filecoin Orbit Builder's Bootcamp is a program designed to teach participants how to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts using the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). This repository serves as my central hub for all tasks, projects, and resources related to the bootcamp.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/Filecoin-Orbit-Builder's-Bootcamp-2025
│
├── Task 1/
│   ├── Project 1/
│   ├── Project 2/
│   └── ...
│
├── Task 2/
│   ├── Project 1/
│   ├── Project 2/
│   └── ...
│
└── ...
```

Each task folder contains subfolders for individual projects, ensuring a clear and organized structure.

## Task Submission Workflow

1. **Complete the Task**: When an instructor assigns a task, I create a folder for it under the appropriate task directory (e.g., `Task 1/Project 1/`).
2. **Push Changes**: After completing the task, I commit and push my changes to this repository.
3. **Submit the Link**: I share the direct link to the relevant folder or file with my instructor for review.

Example:
- If the task is in `Task 1/Project 1/`, I submit the link:
  ```
  https://github.com/Ayomisco/Filecoin-Orbit-Builder-s-Bootcamp-2025/tree/main/Task%201/Project%201
  ```
